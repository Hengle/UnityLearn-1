[Find All References]Sometimes we want to know where an image, material, script, font or gameObject is used, and now there is a very handy tool to help you find these references.The first time you import this tool, it will create cache files in the "ProjectRoot/Library/FindAllReferences" directory, which will greatly improve the query speed.Usage is very simple:1. Select an object in Hierarchy view or Project view.2. Right-Click on the object and select "Find All References"Then you'll see a window showing the results.
